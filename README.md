# Hi Folks :D üëã

My motto, of many others: Many things don't really need an introduction. Just dive in! (that's like an "theoretical learning by doing".)


I started learning C# on 14.7.2022. (Not longer in use)
Now I'm using **C++** since 27.11.2023.

My learning style focuses on deep understanding, which is why new content and code are added gradually and periodically.
At the moment, I am focusing more on theoretical concepts.


After that my plan is to make various scientific simulations and games.
I decided to use Vulkan ‚Äî not for performance reasons, but because I value the manual control it provides.

But also some small applications everyday life. (Details can be found at the bottom)

# Looking for -

- Programmers: C/C++ / Rust (but all others are also welcome!)

- feedback from testers for my projects


**Besides of Programming** there are some areas that are related to Game-Development

- Digital 2D and 3D artists.

- Composers/Musicians (like me): [Info] Respect for all, but I value crafting music with hands over clicking with a mouse.

# Small Personal Info's

## Other
* Male (obviously)
* Unfortunately already 17 Years Old (Time is flying! D:)

## Contact:
Discord: Drominito1010/Drominito1511 |
E-Mail : Drominito.Ketchup@gmail.com

## Fun fact:
- I approach every problem by asking *why*, aiming to understand its core.  
- Balace perfectionism and pragmatism
- Patient, lifelong learner  
- I'm a piano composer and love creating music intuitively.
- Blender/Aseprite enthusiast  
- Creating > Gaming  
- Saving the best for last!

# Legacy C# Projects
Although I don't maintain these anymore, they mark the start of my journey.
Someday, I'll rewrite them in C++ or revisit them for inspiration.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Future Plans ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Simulations
* Sound Engine
* Fluid Engine
* Bacteria
* Physic Based Rendering (PBR)
* Physics/Particle
* Terrain & Procedual Assets generation
* Gravitation & Planets/Galaxy/...

## Games (Only Properties)
* Delivering the best difference so it becomes hard comparable with other games.
* Putting big value in to story and Design Aesthetics
* Even games with minimal graphics should still be enjoyable.
* Commonly about Building/Crafting
* Main Ideas are about Micro-Life-Survival and Space Games.

## Everyday life Programs

* Own Server/Pc/Mobile Data-Exchange
* Automate things (Smarthome <-> Desktop, Smart Home, ...)

## Other

* Embedded/Hardware Programming
* AI (It is a suprise :D)

## Future Learning Path.

### Tools:
* All from "# Tools I use"
* LaTeX
* Docker

### API's
 * C   standard-library
 * C++ standard-library
 * Wayland & SDL3
 * CUDA


    
### Books:
* Much other Books (but they are about like Atonomy/Art, basic Physics, ...)
* Linear Algebra
* Linux
* Vulkan
* Algorithms and Data Structures + Here at most from various Sources
* Calculus,
* Math Acoustics,
* Waves and Vibrations,
* Design(Games, Coding, ..) || / && Psychology about it,
* Digital Signal Processing

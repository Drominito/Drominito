# Hi Folks :D ðŸ‘‹

-- Synonym for Perfection is an Asymptote --

Currently im a Generalist. Focusing on brights and depths.
That's a reason why i'm mostly busy with theories.
It explains why content is not often added.


My view, what i am doing, may be explained as:
Everything what a Game-Engine/Sim-ulations is build on.

_without building a Game-Engine/Sim._

If i would have to decide now which field i want to specialize.
It would be Graphics-Programming.
But because of my "â‰ˆNature" I would start with Software-Rendering.

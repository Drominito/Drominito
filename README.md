# Hi Folks :D ðŸ‘‹

Since at 14.7.2022(Europe-Date-Syntax) had i begun to learn C#.
And now i recently started on around 27.11.2023 to learn C++ :D.

Here you'll find about `Bitmaps (Currently)`, `Graphical-Programming`, Normal `WPF Programs` also somewhat with `Audio`, and later Some `Simulations` the theme about Game-Dev will i begin in `few years`.

I decided learn C++ to have more Controll about the Hardware, have faster Program, want also make purposeful an Game Engine and because i like Low Level Languages.


## Loking for

Artits that use active (Aseprite, Blender, Krita(or Fimilar))

Komponist that make Songs like me. (I'll use in around winter FL Studio, now i make Songs only with my E-Piano)

Programmers: (C# || C++) || (C# && C++)

## Some Info's about me

Now im learning just the basics from C++ and then from other Grafik-API's, first i will start with OpenGL.


These 2 Projects was made with C#, and i dont know when ill work with them again.
I think i would some day recreate it on C++ and expand the Project further.

⁸The long-term tendency is Graphics Programming, even when nothing is visible yet.

# Core Projects
- [playGround](https://github.com/Drominito/playGround) - Experimental prototypes, maybe easter-eggs too
- [Software-Rasterizer](https://github.com/Drominito/Drominito) - CPU-Renderer ( TBD, other priorities)

**Toolchain**: `C` (more TBD - if you insist look older commits)

# Focus Areas
- Terminal Visualisation / Graphics (rapid prototypes)
- Linux DRM/KMS (PoC), then SDL3

# Journey
```diff
- 14.07.2022: C# (WPF)
- 27.11.2023: C++ 
+ 18.01.2025: C & Arch GNU/Linux
```

# Goal
Transition from theory to practical systems programming.
It could anyway still happen that I digress into other topics.
My **Focus Areas** should help me to show where I am.

# Principles
- Synonym for Perfection is an Asymptote
- Focused progress > scattered learning

# Contact
You can contact me, e.g., for help in a project.
I’m likely open for collaboration requests.

The main topic is Graphics-Programming.

# Core Projects
- [playGround](https://github.com/Drominito/playGround) - Experimental prototypes, maybe easter-eggs too
- [Software-Rasterizer](https://github.com/Drominito/Drominito) - CPU-Renderer ( *start* shifted, other priorities)

**Toolchain**: `C` | `GNU` | `Make`

# Focus Areas
- Terminal graphics (ncurses - for Prototypes)
- Linux DRM/KMS(trial), then SDL3

# Journey
```diff
- 14.07.2022: C# (WPF)
- 27.11.2023: C++ 
+ 18.01.2025: C & Arch GNU/Linux
```

# Goal
Transition from theory to practical systems programming.
It could anyway still happen that I digress into other topics.
My **Focus Areas** should help me to show where I am.

# Principles
- Synonym for Perfection is an Asymptote
- Focused progress > scattered learning
